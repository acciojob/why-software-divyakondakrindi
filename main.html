	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
        <p> I loved it. I loved the thrill. I love to see my imagination come to life. I loved gadgets. I choose to be a web
        developer to bring my ideas to life and help others see what I think a better world looks like.</p>
        
       <p>World wide web is everywhere or everyone is on World wide web. If www doesn't existed you are not able to post this
        question and I will not get an opportunity to express my opinion to this question and as a web developer you have the
        ability to involve in this movement and be the frontier of the revolution if you wish too. You can help other lead by
        following them or can help other by leading them.</p> 
        
       <p> Web gave us all a lot. I want to thank each and everyone who put their work in making our life easy and that is why I
        choose to be a web developer Now it is my turn to make people life easy and make this world a better place.</p>
